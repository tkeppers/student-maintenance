# Martial Arts Student Management System

## Overview

The Windsong Dojo Student Management Tool is a Windows Forms application developed in C# using .NET Framework 4.8. This tool is designed to assist Windsong Dojo, a nonprofit martial arts school in Oklahoma City, in managing student information effectively.

## Parameters

When this application is run with no parameters, it will automatically launch in "Student Sign-In" mode. This will allow students to sign in for their martial arts classes, but functionality is otherwise limited.
Run this application with the command line parameter **maintenance** to launch the application in student maintenance mode. This will allow you to add/modify/delete students and their martial arts.
